Examples and sample content (snippets)

One-page system design example (abridged)
Title: Image Upload Service
Requirements:
- Upload images and serve via CDN
- Support resizing and thumbnails
- High availability for reads

APIs:
- POST /upload
- GET /image/{id}?size=small|medium|large

High-level components:
- Client -> Load Balancer -> Upload Service -> Object Storage (S3)
- Thumbnail service (background worker)
- CDN in front of object storage

Data model:
- image: id, owner_id, stored_path, metadata

Scaling plan:
- Use S3 for storage, CDN for reads, queue for processing
- Shard metadata by owner_id if metadata grows

Trade-offs:
- Strong consistency not required for thumbnail creation
- Cost vs latency: pre-generate sizes for hot images

LLD class example (abridged)
Class: ParkingLot
- Methods:
  - parkVehicle(vehicle)
  - unparkVehicle(ticket)
  - getAvailableSlots(type)
- Concurrency:
  - Use locks per floor or per slot to avoid contention

Behavioral example (abridged)
Question: Tell me about a time you led a team under tight deadlines
Answer (STAR):
- Situation: New feature launch with two-week deadline
- Task: Lead backend integration
- Action: Broke features into 3 milestones, coordinated with QA, reduced scope for MVP
- Result: Launched on schedule; reduced bug rate with added integration tests
